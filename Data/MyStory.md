I still remember the first game console I got, which was a PSP. As a child, I didn't think much about how a game was made or how hard it was to make a good game. All I knew was that I got a sense of accomplishment after beating the game and it made me happy. I wanted to share the joy with everyone around me, so on the next day I went back to school, I made a game with pen and paper (basically a simple RPG with a real-life way to compete enemies like rock paper scissors) and played with other classmates. When I saw them enjoy the game, I was incredibly happy like I've just beaten a game and it motivated me to create more games.

After growing up, I found myself pretty good at math and anything related to logic. Hence, I chose math as my college major and took computer science as one of my minors. Apart from the logical rigor and the analytical skill developed from math, I've not only learnt how to be a good programmer, or in specific, writing clean code and being able to think of bright algorithms, but also acquired techinques demanded of game development such as computer graphics, animation and physics implementation.

Being a game developer has been my dream for many years. Thanks to my strength being so related to game development, I decided to try to enter the game industry, and boom, my dream came true! Despite of it, I'm still eager to learn different aspects of game development and always try to further enhance myself.
