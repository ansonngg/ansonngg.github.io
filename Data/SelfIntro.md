Before learning about me, did you discover the Easter egg above? There's actually a minigame! (Only supported on viewport not less than 1280 Ã— 900.)

I'm a game developer and programmer with experience in working on a published game with large codebase, namely, "Tower of Saviors". In this game, my jobs were to maintain it by debugging or even revamping, as well as to do the gameplay implementation and to design visual effects. After I revamped the code, the gameplay manages to support more features, and the number of bugs has also significantly dropped. Besides, from the reviews of players, the ratings of some of my visual effects reached 4 out of 5 on average.

At this moment, I'm seeking to try out different technical positions in game development (preferably graphics or game engine related). I'm willing to work on any types of games, from indie to AAA-titled, since I'd like to gain different kinds of experience!
