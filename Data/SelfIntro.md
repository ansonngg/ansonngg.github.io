Before learning about me, did you discover the Easter egg above? There's actually a minigame! (Only supported on viewport not less than 1200Ã—900.)

I have experience in working at a game company and developing a published game. I have involved in many aspects of game development, from designing visual effect, UI to implementing gameplay logic. I also possess solid knowledge of mathematics and computer graphics.

I love anything about games, be it playing or creating, especially when I am being with other passionate people like me.
