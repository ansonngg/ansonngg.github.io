This is the project I worked on while at Madhead. It is an RPG with thousands of puzzles that require players to use
tile-matching to solve, while providing thousands of characters, each with their own special power to strategically aid
players in solving the puzzles. The game has been published on *App Store* and *Google Play* with more than 200k DAU.

<ULItem>Implemented hundreds of special powers followed by unit tests</ULItem>
<ULItem>Revamped several sections of the codebase to facilitate easier development, maintenance, and broader support for features, such as voice over handler and gameplay UI system (which prompt users for input and apply effects accordingly, as seen in the second image)</ULItem>
<ULItem>Implemented several features that were initially unsupported in the code, requiring significant modifications, such as allowing the timer to check the remaining time proportion when the player stops moving the tile and applying effects accordingly (as shown in the third image)</ULItem>
<ULItem>Designed and created various visual effects (e.g., the one depicted in the fourth image) by utilizing resources provided by artists, utilizing particle systems, and writing shaders</ULItem>
