This is my final project for the computer science course *Principles of Computer Game Software*, created by a group of three individuals. It is a 3D FPS game featuring various collectible and usable weapons for players.

<ULItem>Designed and developed a fully functional level featuring dynamic enemy encounters, including two distinct enemy types along the path, culminating in an intense boss fight at the end</ULItem>
<ULItem>Assisted teammates in locating texture and audio resources on the internet, occasionally editing them using applications like Photoshop or Audacity</ULItem>
<ULItem>Provided coding support, e.g. main/pause menu implementation, victory/defeat checking, etc.</ULItem>
<ULItem>Although not required, engaged with teammates in discussions about game optimization and devised techniques such as object pooling, leaving a lasting impression on the professor</ULItem>
