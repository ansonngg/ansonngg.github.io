This is my final project for the computer science course *Principles of Computer Game Software*, created by a group of
three individuals. It is an FPS game featuring various collectible and usable weapons for players, along with two types
of regular enemies and one boss enemy.

<ULItem>Discovered assets on the Unity Asset Store and constructed the entire level, including designing the distribution of supply points and enemy groups</ULItem>
<ULItem>Assisted teammates in locating texture and audio resources on the internet, occasionally editing them using applications like Photoshop or Audacity</ULItem>
<ULItem>Provided coding support, e.g. main/pause menu implementation, victory/defeat checking, etc.</ULItem>
<ULItem>Although not required, my group engaged in discussions about game optimization and devised techniques such as object pooling, leaving a lasting impression on the professor</ULItem>
