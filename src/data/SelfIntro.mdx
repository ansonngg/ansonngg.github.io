Before learning about me, did you discover the Easter egg above? There's actually a minigame! (Only supported on
viewports not less than 1300 Ã— 900.)

I'm a dedicated game developer with a proven track record in *Tower of Saviors*, a long-standing mobile game boasting
200k+ daily active users (DAU) and $34M annual revenue. I'm actively seeking a programmer position in game development,
whether it involves creating games directly or developing internal tools.
