This is my individual final project for the computer science course *Principles of Computer Graphics*. It utilizes GLFW, GLEW, and GLM libraries. There are also other assignments from the same course available (`csci3260-asg1` and `csci3260-asg2`) in my GitHub profile.

<ULItem>Implemented various advanced techniques, including light rendering, skybox visualization, normal mapping, and object instancing, to enhance the visual quality and performance of the project</ULItem>
<ULItem>Developed separate shader and .obj file readers to decouple the reading logic from the rendering process, streamlining the project's development</ULItem>
<ULItem>Shaders were written in GLSL</ULItem>
<ULItem>Achieved full marks for the project</ULItem>
