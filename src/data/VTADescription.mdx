This is my independent final project for the computer science course *Principles of Computer Graphics*. Developed in
C++, it harnesses the capabilities of OpenGL to render a space environment and spacecraft that players can pilot to
explore space and engage with alien entities. Additionally, you can find other assignments from the same course, such as
`csci3260-asg1` and `csci3260-asg2`, on my GitHub profile.

<ULItem>Implemented various advanced techniques, including light rendering, skybox visualization, normal mapping, and object instancing, to enhance the visual quality and performance of the project</ULItem>
<ULItem>Developed separate shader and .obj file readers to decouple the reading logic from the rendering process, streamlining the project's development</ULItem>
<ULItem>Achieved full marks for the project</ULItem>
