I still remember the first game console I received, which was a PSP. As a child, I didn't ponder much about the process
of game creation or its difficulty in making a good game. All I knew was that I felt a sense of accomplishment after
completing a game, and it brought me joy. I wanted to share this happiness with those around me. So, the next day when I
returned to school, I crafted a game on pen and paper (essentially a simple RPG with real-life elements like
rock-paper-scissors to compete against enemies) and played it with my classmates. Witnessing their enjoyment while
playing the game filled me with immense happiness, akin to the feeling of triumph after completing a game, and it
motivated me to create more games.

As I grew older, I discovered my proficiency in mathematics and anything related to logic. Consequently, I chose
mathematics as my major in college and pursued computer science as one of my minors. Through my mathematical studies, I
honed my logical reasoning and analytical skills. Additionally, my computer science education not only taught me the art
of being a skilled programmer, including writing clean code and devising efficient algorithms, but also introduced me to
various techniques essential to game development, such as computer graphics, animation, and physics implementation.

Being a game developer has been my long-standing dream. Given the alignment between my strengths and game development, I
made the decision to venture into the game industry, and to my delight, my dream came true! However, I remain eager to
explore different facets of game development and continuously strive to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field.
